Playwright_Runtime is a Godot 4.2+ GDExtension that includes a suite of features that are meant for use in my projects.
 The reasoning for including all features in one extension stems from the want to have seamless interoperability between each other,
 and with other C++ gameplay code written in extension form. The idea is to maintain this base repository with all of the generic
 feature sets that can be used in just about any project, and then fork it per-project to also build in any additional custom gameplay
 code relevant to said project.

Current features:
- Branching dialogue runtime (Alpha)
- State machines (Pre-Alpha)

Planned:
- State charts
- Behavior trees
- Save system (?)
- Terrain (?)
