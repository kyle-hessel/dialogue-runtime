These files should all be put in a folder called playwright_runtime
in the project's addons folder. Create that if it does not already exist.
Then, copy the binary for the extension and place it alongside the other
files in the same folder. If building from source, the SConstruct file
will have to be modified to point the completed binary at the right
project. This is also preferable for hot-reloading during development,
as each compile will replace the binary with the new version and the
Godot editor will hot-reload. Lastly, remember to swap the debug binary
with the release binary before exporting a final game.
